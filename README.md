# CEC.Blazor

> **Note the _Experimental_ branch has now been merged into _Master_**

This repository contains my core library development code and a take on the Blazor Weather Application that demonstrates some of the library features.

You can see the Applications in action at these Azure sites:

- [WASM version of CEC Weather Site](https://cec-blazor-wasm.azurewebsites.net/)
- [Server version of CEC Weather Site](https://cec-blazor-server.azurewebsites.net/)
  
The key features are:

- No Router or Navigation Manager.  The application demonstrates an SPA running with no URL routing.
- An alternative implementation of `IComponent` called `Component` 

There are a set of articles in [Release Articles](https://github.com/ShaunCurtis/CEC.Blazor/tree/master/Released%20Articles) that cover the Library and project code in more detail.  These articles are published on CodeProject.

There are also other articles covering specific areas of the Library.
